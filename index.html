Tough luck, Nancy!</br></br>While negotiating, you may either DEFECT to play hardball and demand more, or COOPERATE to work with Pelosi and accept her demands. If both sides DEFECt, there is a two way loss. If both sides COOPERATE, there is a two way gain. If one side cooperates and the other defects, the cooperating side loses. However, do remember that Pelosi does hold some cards - if she loses too much, she may reject the deal entirely.",
